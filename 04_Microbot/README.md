## Files
* Javascript/controller.js, Python/controller.py - runs the remote control for the robot

### How To Run Controller
1) Select radio group - the A button decreases number, the B button increases number, and pressing A and B together locks in the selected group.

2) You will see a happy face to confirm the radio group has been selected

3) You can now send commands to the microbot. The A button turns left, the B button turns right, and pressing A and B together moves the microbot forward.

4) Pictures (arrows) will be displayed on the LEDs to show what command has been sent

### How To Run the Microbot
1) Insert the micro:bit into the moto:bit on top of the micrbot. Attach the power source to the moto:bit. If you turn on the micro:bit before you connect it to the moto:bit, you will throw an error. However you can simply reset the micro:bit to recover from this.

2) Select radio group - the A button decreases number, the B button increases number, and pressing A and B together locks in the selected group.

3) The microbot is ready to receive commands from the remote control.

4) Pictures (arrows) will be displayed on the LEDs to show what command has been received and is being executed.
